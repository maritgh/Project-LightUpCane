LightUpCaneCODE

  Unfortunately we couldnt test parts of the code, due to a not functioning PCB. We did make changes to mainly the Light_Cane_V5 file, where some things havent been tested yet.
  Also due to the USB CDC on boot not being enabled standardly it wouldnt debug in Arduino IDE. So we kindly advice to turn this setting on in the tools slot on arduino IDE.
